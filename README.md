# Social Network API NoSQL

In this project, I applied my new knowledge of a NoSQL database to create a backend server.  To achieve this, I implemented a MongoDB database along with its ODM, Mongoose.  I used a familiar friend, Express.js, for routing purposes, and unlike before, split the routes and its controller functionalities into separate files.  This project was a solid test of my ability to create API routes and integrate a newly learned piece of technology.

## Description

This application serves as a backend database server for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to other users' thoughts, and create a friend list.  The API routes also provide the ability to edit user information or thoughts, delete a user, thought, or reaction, and remove a friend from the friend list.

## Installation/Usage

1. Clone this repository into a local directory.

2. Install the Node dependencies, Express and Mongoose.

3. Start the server on your command line.

4. Open up a cross-platform application such as Insomnia or Postman and begin testing the routes.

## Reflection

I very much enjoyed this challenge, as it provided a good taste of how to work with MongoDB.  Also, despite all of my previous exposure to API routes, this project truly made things click and helped me understand how to properly set up RESTful APIs.  By forcing me to pay attention to the various parameters and body content, this assignment has elevated my skills as a backend developer.
